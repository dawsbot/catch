## ‚öæÔ∏è Catch: Ethereum RPC Caching Made Simple

We hit Ethereum nodes thousands of times a day. Some functions take seconds to resolve, yet they are immutable. If the result is immutable why do we ever recompute it?

Now we don't!

> Catch is a global RPC cache for the entire world to use EVM Chains faster

## üåü FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>ü§ñ Q: How does it know what to catch?</b></summary>
<p>üÖ∞Ô∏è The catch requirements can be specified via a smart-contract that is crowd-sourced. Each chain has its own `CatchManager` deployed, so users on each chain can decide which contracts and functions are worth caching.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>üí∏ Q: Does this save me credits?</b></summary>
<p>üÖ∞Ô∏è YES. Alchemy, Infura, and other providers charge you per-request. If Catch finds a match for your request already in the cache, that data is returned before ever using your credits!</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>‚è∞ Q: Does this save me time?</b></summary>
<p>üÖ∞Ô∏è YES. It is much faster to resolve a cached version than to compute a value dynamically via a function in a smart-contract. <b>The time saving is often over 1 second!</b></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>‚õìÔ∏è Q: What chains does this support?</b></summary>
<p>üÖ∞Ô∏è All Ethereum chains can be easily adopted by forking this repo and deploying a new `CatchManager`. That said, the easier way is to add in high-volume cache heuristics via the `cacheableConfig` directly in the typesript codebase. (more information coming soon)</p>
</details>
<summary><b>‚ôªÔ∏è Q: Does this affect the envionment?</b></summary>
<p>üÖ∞Ô∏è YES. By returning cached results, we save networking bandwidth and decrease energy usage</p>

## Manager Solidity Info

The cache rules are determined by the deployed `CatchManager` contracts deployed to every chain. Here is an example graphic of how the smart-contract works:

![](public/smart-contract-explainer.png)

<br/>

To a new caching rule, simply call `pushCatchConfig` on the smart-contract and include the following data:

- `_to`: What smart-contract address should this rule apply to?
- `_functionSignature`: What function should this rule apply to?
- `_cacheIfEqualTo`: What raw hex string if seen as a response should be applied forever?

Here is an example:

```ts
const to = "0x7FFB3d637014488b63fb9858E279385685AFc1e2";
const functionSignature = "CHILD_CHAIN_ID()";
const cacheIfEqualTo =
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000089";

await contract.pushCatchConfig(to, functionSignature, cacheIfEqualTo);
```

In the future whenever someone wants the `CHILD_CHAIN_ID` from that address, it's served instantly from the cache!
