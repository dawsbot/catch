## ⚾️ Catch: Ethereum RPC Caching Made Simple

We hit Ethereum nodes thousands of times a day. Some functions take seconds to resolve, yet they are immutable. If the result is immutable why do we ever recompute it?

Now we don't!

> Catch is a global RPC cache for the entire world to use EVM Chains faster

## 🌟 FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 Q: How does it know what to catch?</b></summary>
<p>🅰️ The catch requirements can be specified via a smart-contract that is crowd-sourced. Each chain has its own `CatchManager` deployed, so users on each chain can decide which contracts and functions are worth caching.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>💸 Q: Does this save me credits?</b></summary>
<p>🅰️ YES. Alchemy, Infura, and other providers charge you per-request. If Catch finds a match for your request already in the cache, that data is returned before ever using your credits!</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>⏰ Q: Does this save me time?</b></summary>
<p>🅰️ YES. It is much faster to resolve a cached version than to compute a value dynamically via a function in a smart-contract. <b>The time saving is often over 1 second!</b></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>⛓️ Q: What chains does this support?</b></summary>
<p>🅰️ All Ethereum chains can be easily adopted by forking this repo and deploying a new `CatchManager`. That said, the easier way is to add in high-volume cache heuristics via the `cacheableConfig` directly in the typesript codebase. (more information coming soon)</p>
</details>
<summary><b>♻️ Q: Does this affect the envionment?</b></summary>
<p>🅰️ YES. By returning cached results, we save networking bandwidth and decrease energy usage</p>
</details>
